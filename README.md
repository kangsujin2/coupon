# A first-come, first-served coupon system under high concurrency
A Spring Boot-based first-come-first-served coupon issuance system.


## üîπ 1. Project Overview

In a first-come-first-served coupon system, when multiple users simultaneously request the same coupon, the following issues arise:
- Race Conditions: Duplicate coupon issuance due to concurrent requests
- Inventory Management Errors: More coupons issued than actual stock
- Data Consistency Violations: Mismatch between issued quantity and actual issuance records

To solve these concurrency issues, this project implements and performance-tests 5 different strategies:
- **Basic Logic**
- **Pessimistic Locking**
- **Optimistic Locking**
- **Redis Distributed Locking**
- **Redis + Kafka Hybrid Processing**

To further improve performance under high concurrency, the project also includes **Redis-based Optimizations**:
- **Redis Cache Pre-check** 
- **Redis List Queue** 

These are designed to reduce DB load and increase throughput.

The project measures **throughput** and **latency** for each strategy to demonstrate performance improvements in concurrent environments.

## üîπ 2. Architecture

Each branch in this project implements a different concurrency strategy, built on a shared structure defined in the main branch.

- master ‚Äì Shared infrastructure (e.g. controller, service interface, DB config, test utilities)
- [strategy/basic](https://github.com/kangsujin2/coupon/tree/strategy/basic) ‚Äì No concurrency control (baseline)
- [strategy/pessimistic](https://github.com/kangsujin2/coupon/tree/strategy/pessimistic) ‚Äì Pessimistic locking
- [strategy/optimistic](https://github.com/kangsujin2/coupon/tree/strategy/optimistic) ‚Äì Optimistic locking
- [strategy/redis](https://github.com/kangsujin2/coupon/tree/strategy/redis) ‚Äì Redis-based distributed lock
- [strategy/redis-kafka](https://github.com/kangsujin2/coupon/tree/strategy/redis-kafka) ‚Äì Redis atomic validation + Kafka asynchronous processing


For a detailed comparison of each strategy, see the tables below.

## üîπ 3. Concurrency Control Strategy Overview

| Strategy | Description | Pros | Cons | 
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Basic Logic | Simple DB update<br>without concurrency control | ‚Ä¢ Simple implementation | ‚Ä¢ Race conditions<br>‚Ä¢ Data inconsistency | 
| Pessimistic Locking | Database row-level locks<br> (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) | ‚Ä¢ Strong consistency<br>‚Ä¢ Prevents race conditions<br>‚Ä¢ Database-level guarantees | ‚Ä¢ Performance bottleneck<br>‚Ä¢ Lock contention<br>‚Ä¢ Potential deadlocks | 
| Optimistic Locking | Conditional updates<br> (`WHERE quantity > 0`) | ‚Ä¢ No DB-level locks<br>‚Ä¢ Fast under low contention | ‚Ä¢ Retry logic required<br>‚Ä¢ Wasted work on conflict | 
| Redis Lock | Distributed lock<br>(Redisson) | ‚Ä¢ Distributed system support<br>‚Ä¢ High performance<br>‚Ä¢ Scalable across services | ‚Ä¢ External dependency<br>‚Ä¢ Redis availability risk | 
| Redis + Kafka | Atomic Redis validation + async Kafka queue | ‚Ä¢ Extremely high throughput<br>‚Ä¢ Async DB writes<br>‚Ä¢ Event buffering<br>‚Ä¢ Strict deduplication via Lua|‚Ä¢ Operational complexity (infra)<br>‚Ä¢ Eventual consistency|

## üîπ 4. Redis-based Optimizations
To further enhance performance and reduce database load under high concurrency, the following Redis-based optimizations are applied:


### Redis Cache Pre-check
Configured with **Caffeine** and **Redis** cache managers to store coupon availability.  
By checking the cache before querying the database, unnecessary DB hits are avoided and response time is improved.


### Redis Queue Processing
Implements a **Redis-backed queue** to handle coupon issuance requests safely using atomic operations such as `LPOP`.  
This ensures strict **FIFO ordering** and prevents concurrent access issues during high-traffic periods.
